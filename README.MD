# Python OOP and Basic Programming Practice

This repository is a comprehensive collection of Python programs designed to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts alongside core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, such as Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Encapsulation. Additionally, it covers essential Python basics including variables, operators, input/output handling, conditional logic, loops, data structures, functions, slicing, and comprehensions.

## Concepts Covered

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Overview

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm centered around organizing code into objects and classes that represent real-world entities. This approach enhances modularity, promotes code reuse, and simplifies complex software design.

The four foundational pillars of OOP featured in this repository are:

- **Abstraction:** Hiding the complex internal workings of a class and exposing only what is necessary to the user. This reduces complexity and allows users to interact with objects through a simplified interface without needing to understand implementation details.

- **Encapsulation:** Ensuring that an object's data (its attributes) and behavior (its methods) are bundled together, restricting direct access to some of the object's components and thereby protecting its state.

- **Inheritance:** Allowing classes to inherit properties and behaviors from other classes, facilitating code reuse and establishing a natural hierarchy among classes.

- **Polymorphism:** Enabling entities such as functions or operators to handle different data types or classes seamlessly, providing flexibility in code execution.

### Basic Python Programming

This collection also covers various essential Python programming constructs:

- Output and printing techniques
- Variables and their data types
- Arithmetic, relational, assignment, and logical operators
- Conversion and casting between data types
- Accepting user input and formatting output
- Control flow with conditionals (`if`, `else`, `elif`)
- Loops (`for` and `while`)
- Practical tasks such as:
  - Checking even/odd
  - Positive/negative/zero evaluation
  - Largest of two numbers
  - Leap year determination
  - Simple calculator (arithmetic operations)
  - Electricity bill calculation
- **Data structures:**
  - **Lists:** creation, indexing, looping, adding/removing elements, slicing
  - **Tuples:** creation, indexing, immutability
  - **Dictionaries:** key-value pairs, looping, updating, adding/removing elements
- **Functions:** defining functions, parameters, return values, keyword arguments, reusable code, and logic implementation
- **Slicing:** extracting portions of lists, tuples, and strings
- **Comprehensions:** list, dictionary, and set comprehensions for concise and readable code
